Unity Tutorial. 

Project from the tutorial ->

In this is Unity tutorial we will be creating an Interactive Menu similar to the one I developed for my game Viral Wars!
The system in Viral Wars is more complex because it has to load content dynamically, which I am considering to cover in the future.

The goal of this tutorial is to implement a very simple menu system with subcategories!

Hopefully you will find this useful!
Any feedback is greatly appreciated.
